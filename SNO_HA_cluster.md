# High Availability (HA) and Single Node Clusters in OpenShift

This document explores the concepts of High Availability (HA) and Single Node OpenShift (SNO) clusters with real-world relevance, especially in on-premise environments like data centers.

## 🔹 1. Single Node OpenShift Cluster (SNO)

### ✅ Characteristics:
- **1 node** = control plane + compute in the same machine.
- Simplified deployment—ideal for edge or dev/test environments.
- Minimal hardware footprint.
- Lower operational complexity.

### 📌 When to Use:
- Edge computing (remote branches, factories).
- Proof of Concepts (POCs), developer environments.
- Cost-sensitive environments where HA isn't critical.

### ❌ Limitations:
- No fault tolerance — if that single node fails, the entire cluster goes down.
- Cannot horizontally scale workload resiliency.

## 🔹 2. High Availability (HA) OpenShift Cluster

### ✅ Characteristics:
- **3+ control plane nodes** (API servers, schedulers, etcd).
- **2+ worker nodes** for workloads.
- Optionally, infrastructure nodes (for ingress, monitoring, etc.).
- Redundancy across control plane and workers.
- If one master or worker node fails, others take over.
- Supports load balancing (external or internal).
- Scalable and production-ready.

### 📌 When to Use:
- Production environments.
- Workloads requiring uptime SLAs.
- On-premise data centers with high availability goals.
- Environments that need disaster recovery and zero downtime upgrades.

### ❗ Requirements:
- Load balancer for API/ingress (e.g., HAProxy or F5 in on-prem).
- DNS setup, storage backend for PVCs, etc.
- More nodes → more resources and cost.

|-----------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Control Plane Nodes** | 1                       | 3 or more               |
| **Worker Nodes**       | 0 (same as control plane) | 2 or more               |
| **Resiliency**         | ❌ None                 | ✅ Full failover         |
| **Resource Requirements** | Low                   | Medium/High             |
| **Use Case**           | Edge, dev/test          | Production, enterprise   |
| **Complexity**         | Low                     | High                    |
| **Scalability**        | ❌ Limited              | ✅ Full scaling          |
